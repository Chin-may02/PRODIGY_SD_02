# PRODIGY_SD_02

This code runs a fun guessing game in Python! It picks a random number between 1 and 100, and you get to guess what it is. The game tells you if your guess is too low, too high, or just right. Keep guessing until you find the number, and it tracks how many tries you take. If you enter something silly, it gently reminds you to stick to numbers.
